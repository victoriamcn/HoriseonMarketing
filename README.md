# Horiseon Marketing

## Description

The client, Horiseon Marketing Company, wanted codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines.

Additionally, The Horiseon Marketing Company webpage  wanted to include a navigation bar, a header image, and cards with text and images at the bottom of the page.

I learned how to implement semantic elements and when to use 'div' elements, which are not semantic, but useful for styling purposes.

*NOTE: HoriseonMarketing is the new repository I created for this project, as I had deploying issues with the original repository.

You may find the original repository, titled Horiseon-Marketing-Main, with all commits for the HTML and CSS files at this [link](https://github.com/victoriamcn/Horiseon-Marketing-Main).*
